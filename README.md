- Just ignore the performance.h time measurement tbeg,tend,tstr, OpenGLrep4d_double.h keyboard and mouse handler keytab and port VCL related stuff (Canvas,AnsiString,File access, JPEG...).

for each vertical line
- cast ray
- fill from bottom until height
- repeat until full screen height



We can use the raycast distances to label pixels for getting depth


1. Working with Python and C++
2. Add features
3. Compile to JS and work with JS
4. Switch to Julia? (pyjulia, juliaimages)
